# Port-check
This is a small tool for port checking
You should create a 1.txt file in advance to save the initial port status for later tracking of changes. The changed folder contains all port change timestamps. The contents of 1.txt and 2.txt are for testing purposes only—please modify them as needed.

你应该提前创建一个1.txt文件用于保存开始时的端口情况，方便后期查询变动情况，changed文件夹里包含了所有的端口变动时间，1.txt和2.txt中的内容仅用于测试使用，请按照需要自行更改
